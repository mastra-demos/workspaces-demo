# Filesystem

Filesystem providers give agents the ability to read, write, and manage files. When you configure a filesystem on a workspace, agents receive tools for file operations.

A filesystem provider handles all file operations for a workspace:

- **Read** - Read file contents
- **Write** - Create and update files
- **List** - Browse directories
- **Delete** - Remove files and directories
- **Stat** - Get file metadata

## Supported providers

Available providers:

- [`LocalFilesystem`](https://mastra.ai/reference/workspace/local-filesystem) - Stores files in a directory on disk

> **Tip:** `LocalFilesystem` is the simplest way to get started as it requires no external services.

## Basic usage

Create a workspace with a filesystem and assign it to an agent. The agent can then read, write, and manage files as part of its tasks:

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { Workspace, LocalFilesystem } from "@mastra/core/workspace";

const workspace = new Workspace({
  filesystem: new LocalFilesystem({
    basePath: "./workspace"
  })
});

const agent = new Agent({
  id: "file-agent",
  model: "openai/gpt-4o",
  instructions: "You are a helpful file management assistant.",
  workspace
});

// The agent now has filesystem tools available
const response = await agent.generate("List all files in the workspace");
```

## Read-only mode

To prevent agents from modifying files, enable read-only mode:

```typescript
const workspace = new Workspace({
  filesystem: new LocalFilesystem({
    basePath: "./workspace",
    readOnly: true
  })
});
```

When read-only, write tools (`write_file`, `edit_file`, `delete`, `mkdir`) are not added to the agent's toolset. The agent can still read and list files.

## Agent tools

When you configure a filesystem on a workspace, agents receive tools for reading, writing, listing, and deleting files. See [workspace class reference](https://mastra.ai/reference/workspace/workspace-class) for details.
