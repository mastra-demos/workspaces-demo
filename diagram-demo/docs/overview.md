# Workspace

A Mastra workspace gives agents a persistent environment for storing files and executing commands. Agents use workspace tools to read and write files, run shell commands, and search indexed content.

A workspace supports the following features:

- **[Filesystem](https://mastra.ai/docs/workspace/filesystem)**: File storage (read, write, list, delete)
- **[Sandbox](https://mastra.ai/docs/workspace/sandbox)**: Command execution (shell commands)
- **[Search](https://mastra.ai/docs/workspace/search)**: BM25, vector, or hybrid search over indexed content
- **[Skills](https://mastra.ai/docs/workspace/skills)**: Reusable instructions for agents

## How it works

When you assign a workspace to an agent, Mastra includes the corresponding tools in the agent's toolset. The agent can then use these tools to interact with files and execute commands.

You can create a workspace with any combination of the supported features. The agent receives only the tools relevant to what's configured.

## Usage

### Creating a workspace

Create a workspace by instantiating the `Workspace` class with your desired features:

```typescript
import { Workspace, LocalFilesystem, LocalSandbox } from "@mastra/core/workspace";

const workspace = new Workspace({
  filesystem: new LocalFilesystem({
    basePath: "./workspace"
  }),
  sandbox: new LocalSandbox({
    workingDirectory: "./workspace"
  }),
  skills: ["/skills"]
});
```

The `skills` array specifies paths to directories containing skill definitions, see [Skills](https://mastra.ai/docs/workspace/skills).

### Global workspace

Set a workspace on the Mastra instance. All agents inherit this workspace unless they define their own:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { Workspace, LocalFilesystem } from "@mastra/core/workspace";

const workspace = new Workspace({
  filesystem: new LocalFilesystem({ basePath: "./workspace" })
});

const mastra = new Mastra({
  workspace,
  agents: { myAgent }
});
```

### Agent-scoped workspace

Assign a workspace directly to an agent to override the global workspace:

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { Workspace, LocalFilesystem } from "@mastra/core/workspace";

const workspace = new Workspace({
  filesystem: new LocalFilesystem({ basePath: "./agent-workspace" })
});

export const myAgent = new Agent({
  id: "my-agent",
  model: "openai/gpt-4o",
  workspace
});
```

## Initialization

Calling `init()` is optional in most cases—some providers initialize on first operation. Call `init()` manually when using a workspace outside of Mastra (standalone scripts, tests) or when you need to pre-provision resources before the first agent interaction.

```typescript
import { Workspace, LocalFilesystem, LocalSandbox } from "@mastra/core/workspace";

const workspace = new Workspace({
  filesystem: new LocalFilesystem({ basePath: "./workspace" }),
  sandbox: new LocalSandbox({ workingDirectory: "./workspace" })
});

// Optional: pre-create directories and sandbox before first use
await workspace.init();
```

### What init() does

Initialization runs setup logic for each configured provider:

- `LocalFilesystem`: Creates the base directory if it doesn't exist
- `LocalSandbox`: Creates the working directory
- `Search` (if configured): Indexes files from `autoIndexPaths`, see [Search and Indexing](https://mastra.ai/docs/workspace/search)

External providers may perform additional setup like establishing connections or authenticating.

## Tool configuration

Configure tool behavior through the `tools` option on the workspace. This controls which tools are enabled and how they behave.

```typescript
import { Workspace, LocalFilesystem, LocalSandbox, WORKSPACE_TOOLS } from "@mastra/core/workspace";

const workspace = new Workspace({
  filesystem: new LocalFilesystem({ basePath: "./workspace" }),
  sandbox: new LocalSandbox({ workingDirectory: "./workspace" }),
  tools: {
    // Global defaults
    enabled: true,
    requireApproval: false,

    // Per-tool overrides
    [WORKSPACE_TOOLS.FILESYSTEM.WRITE_FILE]: {
      requireApproval: true,
      requireReadBeforeWrite: true
    },
    [WORKSPACE_TOOLS.FILESYSTEM.DELETE]: {
      enabled: false
    },
    [WORKSPACE_TOOLS.SANDBOX.EXECUTE_COMMAND]: {
      requireApproval: true
    }
  }
});
```

### Tool options

| Option                   | Type      | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`                | `boolean` | Whether the tool is available (default: `true`)                             |
| `requireApproval`        | `boolean` | Whether the tool requires user approval before execution (default: `false`) |
| `requireReadBeforeWrite` | `boolean` | For write tools: require reading the file first (default: `false`)          |

### Read-before-write

When `requireReadBeforeWrite` is enabled on write tools, agents must read a file before writing to it. This prevents overwriting files the agent hasn't seen:

- **New files**: Can be written without reading (they don't exist yet)
- **Existing files**: Must be read first
- **Externally modified files**: If a file changed since the agent read it, the write fails
